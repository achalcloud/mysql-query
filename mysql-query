ls /var/lib/mysql     -----> here databse made

To create a new database, run the command: 
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE inventory; 
MariaDB [(none)]> USE inventory; 

To list attributes (or the column names) from a table, use: 
MariaDB [(mysql)]> DESCRIBE servers;

MariaDB [(inventory)]> INSERT INTO product(name,price,stock,id_category,id_manufacturer) VALUES ('SDSSDP-1286-625 2.5',82.04,30, 3,1); 

Delete a record with the delete statement
MariaDB [(inventory))> DELETE FROM product WHERE id = 1 ;

To update a record, use an update statement:
MariaDB [(inventory))> UPDATE product SET price=89.90, stock=60 WHEREE id = 5; 

To read data records from the database, use the select statement: 
MariaDB [(inventory))> SELECT name,price,stock FROM product; 

create a new user
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER mobius@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'redhat'; 

This user account can only connect from localhost, with the password redhat, and has no privileges. Passwords are encrypted in the user table:
MariaDB [mysql]> SELECT host, user, password FROM user WHERE user = 'mobius'; 

If you want to give access to a particular user on a particular DB with particular permissions;
In my case i want to give access of mysql database to user achal with this permissions GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT then follow the bellow steps

mysql -u root -p
use mysql;
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT on mysql.* to achal@localhost; 


MariaDB [(none)]> REVOKE SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT on mysql.* to achal@localhost;
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES, GRANT OPTION FROM achal@localhost;

check privileges  of a user by bellow query;
SHOW GRANTS FOR achal@localhost;

After granting or revoking a privilege, reload all privileges from the privileges tables in the mysql database. 
flush privileges;

DELETE a user by bellow query
drop user achal@localhost;

DELETE FROM category WHERE name LIKE 'Memory'; 
 
 
 A logical backup can be done with the mysqldump command
 mysqldump -u root -p inventory > /backup/inventory.dump
 
 Restoring a backup 
  mysql -u root -p inventory < /backup/mariadb.dump
  
  SET PASSWORD FOR 'achal'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('p@ssw0rd');
  =================================================================
  MySQL(RDS) output query to file(where e is for query
  mysql -h lookchup-rds.cksnrn8rvg6w.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u lookchupdbadmin -p -e "SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST" >fullprocess_list.txt
  
  ============================
  Use the SQL query construct INTO OUTFILE 'filename' to write the results to file from inside the MySQL command line interface:

% mysql -uuser -ppass database
mysql> SELECT id, name INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/smiths.txt' FROM person WHERE name like '%smith%';
Query OK, 10 rows affected (0.01 sec)
===========================================MYSQL-DUMP-RDS========================================================

mysqldump -h ppfas-new.cd9w0gyotnjw.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u username -p dbname(archieso_order) > /var/www/html/amc/archieso_order.bak

mysql[(none)]> use archiesdb_order;
============================================Restore abhove taken DB=========================================
mysql[(archiesdb_order)]> source /var/www/html/amc/archieso_order.bak
